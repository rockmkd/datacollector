 <title>Field Order</title>
 <shortdesc>The Field Order processor orders fields in a map or list-map field and outputs the
        fields into a list-map or list root field. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>processors<indexterm>Field Order</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Field
                    Order<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>Use the Field Order processor
            for the following reasons:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Order the fields in a map field</dt>
                <dd>Fields in a map field have no defined order. Use the Field Order processor to
                    specify the order of the fields and then output the fields to either the
                    list-map or list root field which both retain field order.</dd>
                <dd>For example, letâ€™s say your pipeline reads JSON data and you want to write that
                    data using the delimited data format. <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> uses a map root field for JSON data. However, for a destination to write
                    records as delimited data, the root field type must be list or list-map. You use
                    the Field Order processor to order the fields in the map root field and output
                    the ordered fields to a list-map root field. Then you can write the records as
                    delimited data.</dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>Reorder the fields in a list-map field</dt>
                <dd>Fields in a list-map field have a defined order. Use the Field Order processor
                    when you need to reorder the fields, and then output the fields to the list-map
                    root field.</dd>
            </dlentry>
        </dl>
        <p>When you configure the Field Order processor, you define the order of the fields. You
            specify whether to output the ordered fields to a list-map or list root field.</p>
        <p>You configure how the processor handles missing or extra fields in the record. You can
            also list any fields that you want the processor to discard from the record.</p>
