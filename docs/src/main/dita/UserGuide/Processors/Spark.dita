 <title>Spark Evaluator</title>
 <shortdesc>The Spark Evaluator performs custom processing within a pipeline based on a Spark
        application that you develop. Use the Spark Evaluator in pipelines configured for standalone
        or cluster execution mode. </shortdesc>

                    Evaluator</indexterm></indexterm>The Spark Evaluator processor is especially
            useful when you need to perform heavy custom processing within a pipeline, such as image
            classification.</p>
        <p>Complete the following general tasks to use the Spark Evaluator:<ol id="ol_pmh_33p_zx">
                <li>Write the Spark application using Java or Scala. Then, package a JAR file
                    containing the application.</li>
                <li>Install the application and its dependencies.</li>
                <li>Configure the Spark Evaluator processor to submit the Spark application.<p>When
                        you configure the processor, you define the name of the custom Spark class
                        that you developed and define the arguments to pass to the
                            <codeph>init</codeph> method in the custom Spark class.</p></li>
            </ol><note>The stage libraries that include the Spark Evaluator include all dependencies
                required for the processor. The Spark Evaluator does not require any installation
                prerequisites.</note></p>
