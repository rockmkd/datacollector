 <title>Field Merger</title>
 <shortdesc>The Field Merger merges one or more fields in a record to a different location in the
  record. Use only for records with a list or map structure. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>When you configure the Field Merger, you select the fields to be merged and define the target
   fields. You can merge fields into a new field or an existing field:<dl>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>New target field </dt>
     <dd>When you define a new field, the Field Merger creates the new field and merges the selected
      fields under the new field.</dd>
     <dd>
      <p>For example, you select the following fields in a JSON map:</p>
      <p>
       <codeblock>/City
/State</codeblock>
      </p>
     </dd>
     <dd>If you create a new target field called <codeph>/Location</codeph>, the Field Merger merges
      the fields as follows:<codeblock>/Location/City
         /State</codeblock></dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>Existing target field</dt>
     <dd>When you choose an existing field as the target field, the Field Merger merges the selected
      fields under the target field. You can optionally overwrite target fields of the same name if
      they already exist. </dd>
    </dlentry>
   </dl></p>
 </conbody>
