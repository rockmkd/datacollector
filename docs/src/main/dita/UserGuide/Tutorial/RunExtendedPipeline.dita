    <title>Run the Extended Pipeline</title>
    <shortdesc>Now that the extended pipeline is complete, let's reset the origin and run the
        pipeline again. </shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Reset the origin when you want the Data Collector to process all available data
                instead of processing data from the last-saved offset. Not all origins can be reset,
                but you can reset the origin for Directory.</p>
        </context>
        <steps id="steps_qhq_bwj_rs">
            <step>
                <cmd>In the console menu bar, click the <uicontrol>More</uicontrol> icon: <image
                        href="../Graphics/icon_ConfigMore.png" id="image_c5c_pkk_zs" scale="70"/>.
                    Then, click <uicontrol>Reset Origin</uicontrol>.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>When the confirmation dialog box displays, click <uicontrol>Yes</uicontrol>,
                    then close the dialog box.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>To start the pipeline, click the <uicontrol>Start</uicontrol> icon.</cmd>
            </step>
        </steps>
        <result>The console goes into monitor mode and the data alert triggers again. Before long,
            you'll see some error records in the Jython Evaluator and the Field Type Converter.
                <p>For each stage, you can see the error messages for latest error records.
                </p><p>To look at all the error records, you can review the error record files in
                the directory that you specified. Error records are written in the SDC Record data
                format so you can create an error pipeline to process error records. We'll show you
                how to create an error pipeline to process these error records in a future
                tutorial.</p><p>That's it for this tutorial. Hope you found it helpful!
