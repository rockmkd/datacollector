 <title>JDBC Origins</title>

    <dlentry>
     <dt>My MySQL JDBC Driver 5.0 fails to validate the query in my JBDC Query Consumer origin. </dt>
     <dd>This can occur when you use a LIMIT clause in your query. </dd>
     <dd>Workaround: Upgrade to version 5.1.</dd>
    </dlentry>
    <dlentry>
     <dt>I'm using a JDBC origin to read MySQL data. Why are datetime value set to zero being
      treated like error records?</dt>
     <dd>MySQL treats invalid dates as an exception, so both the JDBC Query Consumer and the JDBC
      Multitable Consumer create error records for invalid dates. </dd>
     <dd>You can override this behavior by setting a JDBC configuration property in the origin. Add
      the zeroDateTimeBehavior property and set the value to "convertToNull".</dd>
     <dd>For more information about this and other MySQL-specific JDBC configuration properties, see
       <xref
       href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html"
       format="html" scope="external"

    <dlentry>
     <dt>A pipeline using the JDBC Query Consumer origin keeps stopping with the following
      error:</dt>
     <dd>
      <codeblock>JDBC_77 &lt;db error message> attempting to execute query '&lt;query>'. Giving up 
after &lt;error count> errors as per stage configuration. First error: &lt;first db error>.</codeblock>
     </dd>
     <dd>This occurs when the origin cannot successfully execute a query. To handle transient
      connection or network errors, try increasing the value for the Number of Retries Upon Query
      Error property on the JDBC tab of the origin. </dd>
    </dlentry>
