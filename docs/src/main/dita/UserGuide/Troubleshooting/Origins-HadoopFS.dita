 <title>Hadoop FS</title>
 <conbody>
  <dl>
   <dlentry>
    <dt>In the pipeline, the Hadoop FS origin has an error icon with the following message:</dt>
    <dd>
     <codeblock>Validation_0071 - Stage '&lt;stage id>' does not support 'Standalone' execution mode</codeblock>
    </dd>
    <dd>You're using the Hadoop FS origin in pipeline configured for standalone execution mode. Use
          the Hadoop FS origin in cluster mode pipelines.</dd>
    <dd>Workaround: In the pipeline properties, set the <uicontrol>Execution Mode</uicontrol> to
      <uicontrol>Cluster</uicontrol>. Or if you want to run the pipeline in standalone mode, use the
     Directory or File Tail origins to process file data. </dd>
