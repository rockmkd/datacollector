                    defaults</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>truststore<indexterm>properties and
                    defaults</indexterm></indexterm>When SSL/TLS is enabled in a stage, you can also
            enable the use of a keystore and a truststore. </p>
        <p>Though similar in many ways, a keystore contains a private key and public certificates
            that are used to verify the identity of the client upon a request from an SSL/TLS
            server. In contrast, a truststore generally contains certificates from trusted
            certificate authorities that an SSL/TLS client uses to verify the identity of an SSL/TLS
            server. </p>
        <p>When you configure a keystore or truststore, you can configure the following properties:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>keystore/truststore type</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>You can use the following types of keystores and truststores:<ul

                    <dd>When specifying the file and location of the keystore or truststore file,
                        you can either use an absolute path to the file or a path relative to the
