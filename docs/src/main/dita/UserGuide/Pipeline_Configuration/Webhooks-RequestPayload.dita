 <title>Payload and Parameters</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>webhooks<indexterm>payload and parameters</indexterm></indexterm>You can include a
            request body or payload for PUT, POST, and DELETE request webhooks. Depending on the
            receiving system, the payload might not be used. For example, when using the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            REST API, you simply include all required information in the URL. </p>
        <p>When you configure a payload, you can use any valid content type, then specify the
            content type in the webhook properties. When defining a message, be sure to consider
            when the pipeline sends the webhook and include the information that the recipient
            needs. </p>
        <p>You can use parameters in the payload to include information about the action that
            triggered the webhook. For example, when configuring a webhook that sends a text message
            when a pipeline stops, you might include the pipeline name, pipeline state, and the time
            parameters in the message.</p>
        <p>Enclose parameters in double curly brackets, as follows:
            <codeblock>{{&lt;parameter name>>}}</codeblock></p>
        <p>You can use the following parameters in webhooks:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>state notification parameters</dt>
                    <dd>When configuring a state notification webhook, you can use the following
                        parameters: <ul id="ul_s3r_nvl_rz">
                            <li>PIPELINE_TITLE - The pipeline title or name.</li>
                            <li>PIPELINE_URL - The direct URL to the pipeline.</li>
                            <li>PIPELINE_STATE - The current state of the pipeline.</li>
                            <li>TIME - The time of the triggered request.</li>
                        </ul></dd>
                    <dd>For example, say you configure the pipeline to send a webhook only when the
                        pipeline transitions to the Stopped state - that is, when someone stops the
                        pipeline. You might use the following message in a JSON request body:
                        <codeblock>{  
   "text":"At {{TIME}}, a user stopped the {{PIPELINE_TITLE}} pipeline. \n &lt;To see the pipeline, click here: {{PIPELINE_URL}}"
}</codeblock></dd>
                    <dd>However, if the pipeline is configured to send webhooks when the pipeline
                        changes to several different states, you might use a more generic message
                        and include the pipeline state in the message. For
                        example:<codeblock>{  
   "text":"The '{{PIPELINE_TITLE}}' pipeline changed state to {{PIPELINE_STATE}} at {{TIME}}. \n &lt;{{PIPELINE_URL}}|Click here for details.>"
}</codeblock></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>alert parameters</dt>
                    <dd>When configuring an alert webhook, you can use the following parameters:<ul
                            id="ul_prs_bhs_rz">
                            <li>ALERT_CONDITION - The condition of the rule associated with the
                                alert.</li>
                            <li>ALERT_NAME - The alert label or name.</li>
                            <li>ALERT_TEXT - The text configured for the alert. </li>
                            <li>ALERT_VALUE - The value that triggered the condition. For example,
                                if the alert is configured to trigger upon reaching 1000 error
                                records, the alert value will be 1000.</li>
                            <li>PIPELINE_TITLE - The pipeline title.</li>
                            <li>PIPELINE_URL - The direct URL to the pipeline.</li>
                            <li>TIME - Time of the triggered request.</li>
                        </ul></dd>
                    <dd>For example, say you configure a pipeline to send a webhook alert each time
                        an alert triggers. To include some key information in the JSON request body,
                        you might try
                        this:<codeblock>{  
   "text":"{{ALERT_TEXT}}: At {{TIME}}, {{ALERT_NAME}} was triggered by {{ALERT_VALUE}} for the following condition: {{ALERT_CONDITION}}. \n This is for the {{PIPELINE_TITLE}} pipeline, at {{PIPELINE_URL}}"
}</codeblock></dd>
                </dlentry>
            </dl></p>
