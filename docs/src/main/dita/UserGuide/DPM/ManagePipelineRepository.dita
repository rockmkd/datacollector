 <title>Manage the Pipeline Repository</title>
 <shortdesc>As a data engineer - the person responsible for making sure that data flows smoothly
        between systems - you use a development <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        instance to develop the pipelines needed to implement the designed data architecture. When
        the pipelines are complete, you publish the pipelines to the pipeline repository in <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><draft-comment author="alisontaylor">text copied from same topic in DPM User Guide. Make
                the same updates in both places. </draft-comment><ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            provides release management of pipelines. A typical pipeline development cycle involves
            iterative changes to the pipeline. <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            maintains the version history of each published pipeline. For example, as you design the
            Social Feeds Dataflows pipeline, you test the pipeline and then make changes to it. As a
            result, you will likely publish the pipeline to the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            pipeline repository multiple times, as displayed in the following image of the pipeline
            history: </p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_ManagePipelineRepository.png" id="image_llt_s4t_bx"
                scale="50"/></p>
        <p>When viewing the pipeline history in <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>,
            you can view the configuration details for any pipeline version and can compare pipeline
            versions side-by-side. For example, if we click the <uicontrol>Compare with Previous
                Version</uicontrol> icon <image
                href="../Graphics/icon_DPM_ComparePreviousVersion.png" scale="70"
                id="image_zqv_3st_bx"/> for version 3 in the image above, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            displays version 2 and version 3 in the comparison window as follows: </p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_ComparePipelineVersions.png" scale="50"
                id="image_bzq_3d5_bx"/></p>
        <p>We can see that version 3 of the pipeline added an Expression Evaluator processor. We can
            drill into the details of each pipeline stage, and compare the configuration of each
            stage between the versions.</p>
        <p>You can add tags to pipeline versions to mark release points or to separate development
            and production environments. For example, when you finish developing the Social Feeds
            Dataflows pipeline, you add a "Ready to Deploy" tag to the latest version. That tag
            informs your DevOps engineer which pipeline version is ready to be added to a job and
            run.</p>
