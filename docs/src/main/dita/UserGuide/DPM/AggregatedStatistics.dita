 <title>Pipeline Statistics</title>
 <shortdesc>A <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
        job defines the pipeline to run and the <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s that
        run the pipeline. When you start a job, <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
        remotely runs the pipeline on the group of <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s. To
        monitor the job statistics and metrics within <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>, you
        must configure the pipeline to write statistics to <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/> or to
        another system.</shortdesc>

            single <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>,
            you can simply configure the pipeline to write the statistics directly to <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>. By
            default, pipelines are configured to write statistics directly to <ph

            />.</p>
        <p>When a job runs on multiple <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s,
            a remote pipeline instance runs on each of the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>s.
            To view aggregated statistics for the job within <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>,
            you must configure the pipeline to write the statistics to one of the following
            systems:</p>
        <ul id="ul_e23_pxp_yy">
            <li>SDC RPC</li>
            <li>Kafka cluster</li>
            <li>Amazon Kinesis Streams</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you start a job that includes a pipeline configured to write to Kafka, Kinesis, or
            SDC RPC, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
            automatically generates and runs a system pipeline for the job. The system pipeline
            reads the statistics written by each running pipeline instance to Kafka, Kinesis, or SDC
            RPC. Then, the system pipeline aggregates and sends the statistics to <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>. </p>

        <p>When a <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"

            statistics and metrics when you monitor the job in <ph
