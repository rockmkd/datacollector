            when you configure a pipeline to write statistics to a Kafka cluster: </p>
        <ul id="ul_vlq_jg5_xw">
            <li>To avoid mixing statistics from different jobs, use a unique topic name for each
                job. </li>
            <li>Consider the Kafka retention policy. <p>Each running pipeline instance writes
                    statistics to Kafka, and then the system pipeline consumes the statistics from
                    Kafka. If the system pipeline unexpectedly shuts down, Kafka retains the
                    statistics for the amount of time determined by the Kafka retention policy. If
                    the system pipeline is down for longer than Kafka retains data, the statistics
                    are lost.</p></li>
