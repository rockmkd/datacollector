 <title>Best Practices for Kinesis Streams</title>

                    statistics for DPM</indexterm></indexterm>Consider the following best practices
            when you configure a pipeline to write statistics to Amazon Kinesis Streams: </p>
        <ul id="ul_w44_3g5_xw">
            <li>To avoid mixing statistics from different jobs, use a unique stream name for each
                job. </li>
            <li>Consider the Kinesis Streams retention policy. <p>Each running pipeline instance
                    writes statistics to Kinesis Streams, and then the system pipeline reads the
                    statistics from Kinesis Streams. If the system pipeline unexpectedly shuts down,
                    Kinesis Streams retains the statistics for the amount of time determined by the
                    Kinesis Streams retention policy. If the system pipeline is down for longer than
                    Kinesis Streams retains data, the statistics are lost.</p></li>
