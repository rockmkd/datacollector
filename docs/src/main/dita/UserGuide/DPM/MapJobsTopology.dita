 <title>Map Jobs into a Topology</title>
 <shortdesc>In <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
        />, you can monitor and view the details of a single pipeline. However, you typically run
        multiple intermediary pipelines, all of which work together to create a complete
        dataflow.</shortdesc>

        <p><draft-comment author="alisontaylor">text copied from same topic in DPM User Guide. Make
                the same updates in both places. </draft-comment>As a data architect, you create a
            topology in <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/> to
            map multiple related jobs into a single view. A topology provides interactive end-to-end
            views of data as it traverses multiple pipelines.</p>
        <p>To continue our Customer 360 example, after the WebLog Collection pipeline reads web
            server log files and writes the data to Kafka, another pipeline consumes the Kafka data,
            processes it, and streams the data to HDFS. Additional pipelines read from Twitter
            social feeds and from an enterprise data warehouse and also write the data to HDFS. In
                <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"
            />, you can create a topology that includes jobs for all the pipelines, as follows: </p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_MapPipelinesTopology.png" scale="50" id="image_um3_nk1_cx"
            /></p>
        <p>From the topology, you can select each job and then drill into the configuration details
            of each pipeline. You can add any number of jobs to a topology.</p>
