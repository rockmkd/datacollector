    <title>Viewing Pipeline Commit History</title>
    <shortdesc>You can view the commit history of any pipeline that has been published to <ph
            conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>. If the
        pipeline has been committed multiple times, you can get an older version of the pipeline and
        then continue editing the older version.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p><indexterm>pipelines<indexterm>commit
                    history</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>commit
                        history<indexterm>pipelines</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>DPM<indexterm>pipeline
                        commit history</indexterm></indexterm>If you edit and then publish an older
                version, <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
                updates the minor version number rather than the major version number. For example,
                you have a pipeline with three versions. You get version 2 of the pipeline, edit the
                pipeline, and then publish the pipeline. <ph
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/DPM-short"/>
                versions the current pipeline as 2.1. So you now have four versions of the pipeline,
                with version 2.1 of the pipeline marked as the current version:</p>
            <ul id="ul_fcc_1v3_fx">
                <li>2.1</li>
                <li>3</li>
                <li>2</li>
                <li>1</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To view pipeline commit history:</p>
        </context>
        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>In the pipeline canvas, click the <uicontrol>DPM Options</uicontrol> icon
                        <image href="../Graphics/icon_RemoteStore.png" id="image_lc3_kbf_2w"
                        placement="inline" scale="80"/>, and then click <uicontrol>Commit
                        History</uicontrol>. </cmd>
                <info>The <uicontrol>Pipeline Commit History</uicontrol> dialog box opens. For
                    example, a pipeline with three versions displays the commit history as
                            follows:<p><image href="../Graphics/DPM_PipelineCommitHistory.png"
                            scale="60" id="image_a4r_f2d_fx"/></p></info>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>To get an older version of a pipeline, click <uicontrol>Get</uicontrol> in the
                        <uicontrol>Actions</uicontrol> column for that version.</cmd>
                <info><ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> opens the selected pipeline version in the canvas. You can make edits to the
                    pipeline version, and then publish the pipeline as another version.</info>
