  <p><indexterm>MapReduce executor<indexterm>prerequisites</indexterm></indexterm>Before you run a
            pipeline that includes MapReduce executor, you must enable MapReduce executor to submit
            a job. </p>
        <p>You can enable MapReduce executor to submit a job in several different ways. Perform
                <u>one</u> of the following tasks to enable the executor to submit jobs: <dl>
