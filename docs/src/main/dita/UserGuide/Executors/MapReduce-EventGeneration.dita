                    executor</indexterm></indexterm>The MapReduce executor can generate events that
            you can use in an event stream. When you enable event generation, the executor generates
            events each time it starts a MapReduce job.</p>
        <p>MapReduce executor events can be used in any logical way. For example: <ul
                id="ul_dzf_tpg_zx">
                <li
