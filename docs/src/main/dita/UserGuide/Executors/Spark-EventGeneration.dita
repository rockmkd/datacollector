 <title>Event Generation</title>

                    executor</indexterm></indexterm>The Spark executor can generate events that you
            can use in an event stream. When you enable event generation, the executor generates
            events each time it starts a Spark application. </p>
        <p>Spark executor events can be used in any logical way. For example: <ul id="ul_dzf_tpg_zx">
                <li
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/D-li-Event-Email"/>
                <li
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/D-li-Event-FileStore"
                />
            </ul></p>
        <p>Since Spark executor events include the application ID for each application that it
            starts, you might generate events to keep a log of the application IDs.</p>
