            does not monitor Spark applications. Use your regular cluster monitor application to
            view the status of applications. </p>
        <p>Applications started by the Spark executor display using the application name specified
            in the stage. The application name is the same for all instances of the application. You
            can find the application ID for a particular instance in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            log.</p>
        <p>The Spark executor also writes the application ID to the event record. To keep a record
            of all application IDs, enable event generation for the stage. </p>
