 <title>Using a Proxy Hadoop User</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>Spark executor<indexterm>using a Hadoop user for
            YARN</indexterm></indexterm>You can configure the Spark executor to use a Hadoop user as
            a proxy user to submit applications to Spark on YARN. </p>
        <p>By default, the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            uses the user account who started it to connect to external systems. When using
            Kerberos, the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            can use the Kerberos principal specified in the executor.</p>
        <p>To use a Hadoop user, perform the following tasks:<ol id="ol_vmj_jtg_gz">
                <li>On the external system, configure the <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> user as a proxy user and authorize the <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> user to impersonate the Hadoop user. <p>For more information, see the Hadoop
                        documentation. </p></li>
                <li>In the Spark executor, on the <uicontrol>Spark</uicontrol> tab, configure the
                        <uicontrol>Proxy User</uicontrol> property to use the Hadoop user name.</li>
            </ol></p>
