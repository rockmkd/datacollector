                    Metadata executor</indexterm></indexterm>The HDFS File Metadata executor can
            generate events that you can use in an event stream. When you enable event generation,
            the executor generates events each time it changes file metadata or creates an empty
            file.</p>
        <p>HDFS File Metadata events can be used in any logical way. For example: <ul>
                <li
                    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/D-li-Event-Email"/>
                <li
