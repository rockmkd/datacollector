                    Query</indexterm></indexterm>The JDBC Query executor connects through JDBC to a
            database and performs a user-defined SQL query each time it receives an event record.
            Use the JDBC Query executor as part of an event stream in the pipeline. </p>
        <p>When you configure the JDBC Query executor, you specify JDBC connection properties and
            the query you want to use. You can configure custom properties that your driver requires
            and advanced connection properties. </p>
        <p>To use a JDBC version older than 4.0, you can specify the driver class name and define a
            health check query.</p>
