 <title>Cluster Pipeline Overview</title>
 <shortdesc>A <term>cluster pipeline</term> is a pipeline that runs in cluster execution mode. You
  can run a pipeline in standalone execution mode or cluster execution mode. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>execution mode<indexterm>standalone and cluster
    modes</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>cluster
    mode<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>standalone
     mode<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>In standalone mode, a single <ph
    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> process runs
   the pipeline. A pipeline runs in standalone mode by default. </p>
  <p>In cluster mode, the <ph
    conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> uses a cluster
   manager and a cluster application to spawn additional workers as needed. Use cluster mode to read
   data from a Kafka cluster, MapR cluster, or HDFS.</p>
  <p>When would you choose standalone or cluster mode? Say you want to ingest logs from application
   servers and perform a computationally expensive transformation. To do this, you might use a set
   of standalone pipelines to stream log data from each application server to a Kafka or MapR
   cluster. And then use a cluster pipeline to process the data from the cluster and perform the
   expensive transformation.</p>
  <p>Or, you might use cluster mode to move data from HDFS to another destination, such as
   Elasticsearch.</p>
