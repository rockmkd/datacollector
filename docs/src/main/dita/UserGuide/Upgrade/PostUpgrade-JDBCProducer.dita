 <title>Configure JDBC Producer Schema Names</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>With Data Collector version 2.5.0.0, you can use a Schema Name property to specify the
            database or schema name. In previous releases, you specified the database or schema name
            in the Table Name property. </p>
        <p>Upgrading from a previous release does not require changing any existing configuration at
            this time. But we recommend using the new Schema Name property, since the ability to
            specify a database or schema name with the table name might be deprecated in the future. </p>
    </conbody>
