 <title>Working with a Cloudera CDH 5.11 System</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>When you upgrade to Cloudera CDH version 5.11 from a previous version, you must update
            pipelines that set permissions on HDFS or Hive by modifying file mode bits with the
            minus or equals operators.<draft-comment author="Loretta">Update this when we support
                additional > 5.11 versions - to say something like... when upgrading from versions
                "earlier to 5.11 to version 5.11 or later"  5/9/2017.</draft-comment></p>
        <p>Pipelines can modify file mode bits on HDFS or Hive with the following stage
                properties:<ul id="ul_xgb_ygq_vz">
                <li>The HDFS File Metadata executor Set Permissions property</li>
                <li>The Hadoop FS destination whole file Permissions Expression whole file
                    property</li>
            </ul>CDH 5.11 changes how the minus and equals operators are evaluated as follows:<ul
                id="ul_j5b_vgq_vz">
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p>In previous CDH releases, the minus operator (-) grants the specified
                        permissions. In the current release, it removes the specified permissions. </p>
                    <p>For example, in previous releases, <codeph>a-rw</codeph> grants read and
                        write permissions to all users. With CDH 5.11, it removes read and write
                        permissions from all users. </p>
                </li>
                <li dir="ltr">
                    <p>In earlier CDH releases, the equals operator (=) removes the specified
                        permissions. In the current release, it grants the specified permissions. </p>
                    <p>For example, in previous releases, <codeph>a=we</codeph> removes write and
                        execute permission from all users. With CDH 5.11, it grants write and
                        execute permission to all users. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>To ensure that file permissions are set as expected, update all properties in
            upgraded pipelines that modify file mode bits with the minus or equals operators.</p>
