 <title>Evaluate Precondition Error Handling</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>With Data Collector version 2.5.0.0, precondition error handling has changed. </p>
        <p>The Precondition stage property allows you to define conditions that must be met for a
            record to enter the stage. Previously, records that did not meet all specified
            preconditions were passed to the pipeline for error handling. That is, the records were
            processed based on the Error Records pipeline property. </p>
        <p>With version 2.5.0.0, records that do not meet the specified preconditions are handled by
            the error handling configured for the stage. Stage error handling occurs based on the On
            Record Error property on the General tab of the stage.</p>
        <p>Review pipelines that use preconditions to verify that this change does not adversely
            affect the behavior of the pipelines.</p>
