 <title>State Transition Examples</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Here are some examples of how pipelines can move through states:<dl>
                <dlentry>
                    <dt>Starting a pipeline</dt>
                    <dd>When you successfully start a pipeline for the first time, a pipeline
                        transitions through the following
                        states:<codeblock>(EDITED)... STARTING... RUNNING</codeblock></dd>
                    <dd>When you start a pipeline for the first time but it cannot start, the
                        pipeline transitions through the following
                        states:<codeblock>(EDITED)... STARTING... START_ERROR</codeblock></dd>
                </dlentry>
                <dlentry>

                    <dd>

                        following
                        states:<codeblock>DISCONNECTED... CONNECTING... STARTING... RUNNING</codeblock></dd>

                    <dt>Retrying a pipeline</dt>
                    <dd>When a pipeline is configured to retry upon error, <ph

                        errors while running. </dd>
                    <dd>When retrying upon error and successfully retrying, a pipeline transitions
                        through the following
                        states:<codeblock>(RUNNING)... RUNNING_ERROR... RETRY... STARTING... RUNNING</codeblock></dd>
                    <dd>When retrying upon error and encountering another error, a pipeline
                        transitions through the following
                        states:<codeblock>(RUNNING)... RUNNING_ERROR... RETRY... STARTING... RUNNING... RUNNING_ERROR... </codeblock></dd>
                    <dd>When performing a final retry and unable to return to a Running state, a
                        pipeline transitions through the following states:
                        <codeblock>(RUNNING)... RUNNING_ERROR... RUN_ERROR</codeblock></dd>
