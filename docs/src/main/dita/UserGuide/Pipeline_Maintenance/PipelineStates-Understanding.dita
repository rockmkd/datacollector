 <title>Understanding Pipeline States</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>pipeline state<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>A pipeline state is the
            current condition of the pipeline, such as "running" or "stopped". The pipeline state
            can display in the All Pipelines list. The state of a pipeline can also appear in the
                <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
            /> log.</p>
        <p>The following pipeline states often display in the All Pipelines list:<ul
                id="ul_nm3_xwq_mz">
                <li>EDITED - The pipeline has been created or modified, and has not run since the
                    last modification.</li>
                <li>FINISHED - The pipeline has completed all expected processing and has stopped
                    running.</li>
                <li>RUN_ERROR - The pipeline encountered an error while running and stopped.</li>
                <li>RUNNING - The pipeline is running.</li>
                <li>STOPPED - The pipeline was manually stopped. </li>
                <li>START_ERROR - The pipeline encountered an error while starting and failed to
                    start. </li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>The following pipeline states are transient and rarely display in the All Pipelines list.
            These states can display in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            log when the pipeline logging level is set to Debug:<ul id="ul_mml_fxq_mz">
                <li>CONNECT_ERROR - When running a cluster-mode pipeline, Data Collector cannot
                    connect to the underlying cluster manager, such as Mesos or YARN.</li>
                <li>CONNECTING - The pipeline is preparing to restart after a <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> restart. </li>
                <li>DISCONNECTED - The pipeline is disconnected from external systems, typically
                    because <ph
                        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"
                    /> is restarting or shutting down.</li>
                <li>FINISHING - The pipeline is in the process of finishing all expected
                    processing.</li>
                <li>RETRY - The pipeline is trying to run after encountering an error while running.
                    This occurs only when the pipeline is configured for a retry upon error. </li>
                <li>RUNNING_ERROR - The pipeline encounters errors while running.</li>
                <li>STARTING - The pipeline is initializing, but hasn't started yet. </li>
                <li>STOPPING - The pipeline is in the process of stopping after a manual request to
                    stop.</li>
            </ul></p>
