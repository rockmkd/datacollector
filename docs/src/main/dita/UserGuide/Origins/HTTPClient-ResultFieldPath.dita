 <title>Result Field Path</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>HTTP Client origin<indexterm>result field path</indexterm></indexterm>When using
            pagination, you must specify the result field path. The result field path is the
            location in the response that contains the data that you want to process. </p>
        <p>The result field path must be a list or array. The origin creates a record for each
            object in the array. </p>
        <p>For example, to process the following response, you would use /results for the result
			field
			path:<codeblock>{  
   "count":"1023",
   "startAt":"2",
   "maxResults":"2",
   "total":"6",
   "results":[  
      {  
         "firstName":"Joe",
         "lastName":"Smith",
         "phone":"555-555-5555"
      },
      {  
         "firstName":"Jimmy",
         "lastName":"Smott",
         "phone":"333-333-3333"
      },
      {  
         "firstName":"Joanne",
         "lastName":"Smythe",
         "phone":"777-777-7777"
      }
   ]
}</codeblock></p>
        <p>From this data, the origin creates three records. The first
			record:<codeblock>{  
   "firstName":"Joe",
   "lastName":"Smith",
   "phone":"555-555-5555"
}</codeblock></p>
        <p>The second
			record:<codeblock>{  
   "firstName":"Jimmy",
   "lastName":"Smott",
   "phone":"333-333-3333"
}</codeblock></p>
        <p>And the third
			record:<codeblock>{  
   "firstName":"Joanne",
   "lastName":"Smythe",
   "phone":"777-777-7777"
}</codeblock></p>
