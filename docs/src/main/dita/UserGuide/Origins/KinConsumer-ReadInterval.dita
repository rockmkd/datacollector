 <title>Read Interval</title>
 <shortdesc>You can configure the read interval for the Kinesis Consumer. The read interval
  determines how long Kinesis Consumer waits before requesting additional data from Kinesis shards.
  By default, the Kinesis Consumer waits one second between requests. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>Kinesis Consumer origin<indexterm>read interval</indexterm></indexterm>Adjust the
   read interval to adapt to the Kinesis data load. For example, you might reduce the wait time to
   enable higher throughput or increase the wait time when the stream of data slows. </p>
  <p>Amazon recommends 1 second read intervals. The minimum read interval for the Kinesis Consumer
            is 200 milliseconds which enables polling five times a second. To increase total
            capacity, you can create additional shards for the cluster. </p>
