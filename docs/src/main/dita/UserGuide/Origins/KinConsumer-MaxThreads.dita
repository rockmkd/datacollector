 <title>Max Thread Guideline</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Before processing data from a shard, each thread obtains a lease on a shard. &lt;blah blah> </p>
        <p>So when configuring the Max Thread property, you generally want to set the number of
            threads equal to, or less than the number of shards getting processed</p>
