            performs parallel processing and enables the creation of a multithreaded pipeline. </p>
        <p>When you enable multithreaded processing, the TCP Server origin uses multiple concurrent
            threads based on the Number of Receiver Threads property. When you start the pipeline,
            the origin creates the number of threads specified in the property. </p>
        <p>As clients initiate TCP connections, the origin establishes TCP sessions and waits for
            data. Upon filling a batch, the origin passes the batch to an available pipeline runner. </p>

        <p>For example, say you enable multithreaded processing and set the Number of Receiver
            Threads property to 5. When you start the pipeline, <ph
