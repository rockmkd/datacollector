 <title>WebSocket Server</title>
 <shortdesc>The WebSocket Server origin is a multithreaded origin that listens on a WebSocket
        endpoint and processes the contents of all authorized WebSocket requests. Use the WebSocket
        Server origin to read high volumes of WebSocket requests using multiple threads. </shortdesc>

            origin can use multiple threads to enable parallel processing of data from multiple
            WebSocket clients. </p>
        <p>Before you configure the origin, perform additional steps to configure the WebSocket
            clients. </p>
        <p>When you configure the WebSocket Server origin, you specify the maximum number of
            concurrent requests to determine how many threads to use. You define the listening port,
            application ID, and the maximum message size. <ph
