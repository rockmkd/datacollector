 <title>Include the Application ID in Requests</title>
 <shortdesc>Configure the HTTP clients to include the HTTP Server application ID in each
        request.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p>When you configure the HTTP Server origin, you define an application ID that is used to
            pass requests to the origin. All messages sent to the origin must include the
            application ID.<draft-comment author="alisontaylor">same as the Prerequisites for
                WebSocket Server origin, make updates in both places</draft-comment></p>
        <p>Include the application ID for each client request in one of the following ways:</p>
        <dl>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>In request headers</dt>
                <dd>Add the following information to the request header for all HTTP POST requests
                    that you want the origin to
                    process:<codeblock>X-SDC-APPLICATION-ID: &lt;application_ID></codeblock></dd>
                <dd>For example:<codeblock>X-SDC-APPLICATION-ID: sdc_http2kafka</codeblock></dd>
            </dlentry>
            <dlentry>
                <dt>In a query parameter in the URL</dt>
                <dd>If you cannot configure the client request headers - for example if the requests
                    are generated by another system - then configure each HTTP client to send data
                    to a URL that includes the application ID in a query parameter.</dd>
                <dd>To include the application ID in a query parameter, enable the <uicontrol>Allow
                        Application ID through Query Param</uicontrol> property when you configure
                    the origin. Then, include the application ID in a URL query parameter.</dd>
                <dd>Use the following format for the
                    URL:<codeblock>&lt;http | https>://&lt;sdc_hostname>:&lt;listening_port>/?sdcApplicationId=&lt;application_ID></codeblock></dd>
                <dd>The URL includes the following components:<ul id="ul_xsc_15d_kz">
                        <li>&lt;http | https> - Use https for secure HTTP connections. </li>
                        <li>&lt;sdc_hostname> - The <ph

                            /> host name.</li>
                        <li>&lt;listening_port> - The port number where the origin listens for data. </li>
                        <li>&lt;application_ID> - The application ID defined for the HTTP Server
                            origin.</li>
                    </ul></dd>
                <dd>For example:
                        <codeph>https://localhost:8000/?sdcApplicationId=sdc_http2kafka</codeph></dd>
