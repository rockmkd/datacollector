                    process<indexterm>SFTP/FTP Client origin</indexterm></indexterm>Configure a
            first file for processing when you want the SFTP/FTP Client origin to ignore one or more
            existing files in the directory.</p>
        <p>When you define a first file to process, the origin starts processing with the specified
            file and continues processing files in the expected read order: files that match the
            file name pattern in ascending order based on the last-modified timestamp. </p>
        <p>When you do not specify a first file, the origin processes the files in the directory
            that match the file name pattern, starting with the earliest file and continuing in
            ascending order.</p>
        <p>For example, if you specify a first file with the last-modified timestamp of 6/01/2017
            00:00:00, the origin starts processing with that file and ignores all older files in the
                directory.<note>When you restart a stopped pipeline, the origin ignores this
                property. It starts where it left off regardless of the first file name unless you
                reset the origin. </note></p>
