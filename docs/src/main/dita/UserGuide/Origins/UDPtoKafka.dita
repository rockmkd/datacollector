                    to Kafka</indexterm></indexterm>The UDP to Kafka origin reads messages from one
            or more UDP ports and writes each message directly to Kafka.</p>
        <p>Use the UDP to Kafka origin to read large volumes of data from multiple UDP ports and
            write the data immediately to Kafka, without additional processing.</p>
        <p>Here is an example of the recommended architecture for using the UDP to Kafka origin:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/UDPtoKafka-arch.png" id="image_jkp_jhn_vw" scale="80"/></p>
        <p>If you need to process data before writing it to Kafka, need to write to a destination
            system other than Kafka, or if the origin does not need to process high volumes of data,
            use the UDP Source origin.</p>

            </ul></p>
     <p>When you configure UDP to Kafka, you specify the UDP ports to use, Kafka
            configuration information, and advanced properties such as the maximum number of write
            requests.</p>
        <p>You can add Kafka configuration properties and enable Kafka security as needed. </p>
