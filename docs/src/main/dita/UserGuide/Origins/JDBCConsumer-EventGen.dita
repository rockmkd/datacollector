            when it fails to complete.</p>
        <p>You can use JDBC Query Consumer events in the following ways:<ul id="ul_i2s_3h1_4z">
                <li>With the Pipeline Finisher executor to stop the pipeline and transition the
                    pipeline to a Finished state when the origin completes processing available
                        data.<p>When you restart a pipeline stopped by the Pipeline Finisher
                        executor, the origin processes data based on how you configured the origin.
                        For example, if you configure the origin to run in incremental mode, the
                        origin saves the offset when the executor stops the pipeline. When it
                        restarts, the origin continues processing from the last-saved offset. In
                        contrast, if you configure the origin to run in full mode, when you restart
                        the pipeline, the origin uses the initial offset.</p><p>For an example, see
