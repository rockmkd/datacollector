            <p>To configure a user in the origin to read from MapR FS, perform the following
                tasks:<ol id="ul_mb1_xpt_ls">
                <li>On MapR, configure the user as a proxy user and authorize the user to
                    impersonate the Hadoop user. <p>For more information, see the MapR
                        documentation. </p></li>
                <li>In the MapR FS origin, on the <wintitle>Hadoop FS</wintitle> tab, configure the
                        <uicontrol>Hadoop FS User</uicontrol> property.</li>
