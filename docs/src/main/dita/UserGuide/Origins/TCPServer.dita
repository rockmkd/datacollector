                    Server</indexterm></indexterm>The TCP Server origin listens at the specified
            port numbers, establishes TCP sessions with clients that initiate TCP connections, and
            then processes the incoming data.</p>
        <p>The origin can process NetFlow messages, syslog messages, and supported <ph

            data formats with records separated by specified characters.</p>
        <p>The TCP Server can process data from can process data from multiple clients
            simultaneously, creating separate batches for each client, and sending acknowledgements
            to the originating client after parsing each record or committing each batch. You can
            configure the origin to use multiple threads to improve performance when processing of
            large volumes of data. And on 64-bit Linux systems, you can enable native Epoll
            transports to further improve performance.</p>
        <p>When you configure the TCP Server origin, you specify the ports to use and the TCP mode
            that indicates the type of data the origin will receive. Then you configure mode-related
            properties, such as the characters that separate records. </p>
        <p>You can optionally configure the acknowledgements that you want to send. <ph
