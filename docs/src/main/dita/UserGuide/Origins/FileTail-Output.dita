 <title>File Tail Output</title>
  <shortdesc>File Tail provides data and related metadata through separate output streams. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>File Tail origin<indexterm>output</indexterm></indexterm>The origin passes
      information through the following output locations:<dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Data</dt>
          <dd>Passes data read from the origin.</dd>

          <dt>Metadata</dt>
          <dd>
            <note type="important">This functionality will be deprecated in a future release. The
              record generated by the metadata output is the same as the File Tail event record.
              Best practice is to connect the metadata output to the Trash destination. Then, to use
              the event record, configure the origin to generate events. For more information, see
                <xref href="FileTail-EventGeneration.dita#concept_gwn_c32_px"/>.</note>
          </dd>
          <dd>Passes information generated about file processing. To retain this information for
            review, connect the metadata output location to any other destination or route the data
            as necessary. If you do not require this information, connect the metadata output
            location to the Trash destination. </dd>
          <dd>File processing metadata includes the following fields:<ul id="ul_hnd_1s4_1s">
              <li>fileName - Name of the file.</li>
              <li>inode - Index information for the file.</li>
              <li>time - Time that the event occurred.</li>
              <li>event - Processing event. START indicates that File Tail started processing the
                specified file. END indicates that File Tail completed processing the contents of
                the file. </li>
            </ul></dd>
          <dd>
            <note>Inode most reliably identifies a file when a server renames archived files.
