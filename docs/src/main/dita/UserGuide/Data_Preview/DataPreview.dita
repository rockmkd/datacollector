 <title>Data Preview Overview</title>
 <shortdesc>You can preview data to help build or fine-tune a pipeline. When you preview data, the
            <ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
        passes data through the pipeline and allows you to review how the data passes through each

            help you configure the pipeline. After you configure the origin and link the stages that
            you want to review, you start the data preview. </p>
        <p>In preview mode, you cannot add or delete stages, but you can edit stage properties and
            run the preview again to see how your changes affect preview data. Similarly, you can
            edit preview data to test and tune pipeline configuration. </p>
        <p>You can preview data for one stage at a time or for a group of stages. You can view the
            data in list or table view. You can also refresh the preview data.</p>
