                    pipelines</indexterm></indexterm>When you monitor a multithreaded pipeline, the
            pipeline and stage statistics that display are for the entire pipeline, aggregated
            across all pipeline runners.</p>
        <p>Monitor mode provides the following Available Pipeline Runners Histogram: </p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Multithreaded-Stats.png" id="image_bzb_yxf_sy" scale="70"/></p>
        <p>The histogram shows a changing snapshot of the frequency of available pipeline runners and
            the number of runners that are currently available. If you are uncertain of the number
            that a column displays, hover over it to view the column detail.</p>
        <p>For example, the histogram above indicates that the mean is 1.4 available runners, and
            the standard deviation is one runner.</p>
