 <title>Event Storage Streams</title>
 <conbody>
        <p><indexterm>event streams<indexterm>event storage</indexterm></indexterm>An event storage
            stream routes event records from the event generating stage to a destination. The
            destination writes the event record to a destination system.</p>
        <p>Event records include information about the event in record header attributes and record
            fields. You can add processors to the event stream to enrich the event record before
            writing it to the destination. </p>
        <p>For example, you have a pipeline that uses the Directory origin to process weblogs:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-Directory.png" scale="70" id="image_g5w_m1f_zx"/></p>
        <p>Directory generates event records each time it starts and completes reading a file, and
            the event record includes a field with the file path of the file. For auditing purposes,
            you'd like to write this information to a database table.</p>
        <p>Leaving the rest of the pipeline as is, you can enable event handling for the Directory
            origin and simply connect it to the JDBC Producer as follows:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-Directory-JDBC.png" scale="60" id="image_d2y_1vq_tx"/></p>
        <p>But you want to know when events occur. The Directory event record stores the event
            creation time in the sdc.event.creation_timestamp record header attribute. So you can
            use an Expression Evaluator with the following expression to add the creation date and
            time to the record:
            <codeblock>${record:attribute('sdc.event.creation_timestamp')}</codeblock></p>
        <p>And if you have multiple pipelines writing events to the same location, you can use the
            following expression to include the pipeline name in the event record as
            well:<codeblock>${pipeline:name()}</codeblock></p>
        <p>The Expression Evaluator and the final pipeline looks like this:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-Directory-ExpJDBC.png" scale="55" id="image_e2y_1vq_tx"
            /></p>
    </conbody>
</concept>
