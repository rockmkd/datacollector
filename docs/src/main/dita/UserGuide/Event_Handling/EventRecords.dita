 <title>Event Records</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>event records<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>Event records are records
            created by a stage when a stage-related event occurs, like when an origin starts reading
            a new file or a destination closes an output file. </p>
        <p>Most event records pass general event information in record headers, such as when the
            event occurred. They also include event-specific details in record fields, like the name
            and location of the output file that was closed. </p>
        <p>Event records generated by the File Tail origin are the exception - they include all
            event information in record fields. </p>
