 <title>Task Execution Streams</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>event streams<indexterm>task execution</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>task
                execution event streams<indexterm>description</indexterm></indexterm>A task
            execution stream routes event records from the event generating stage to an executor
            stage. The executor performs a task each time it receives an event record. </p>
        <p>For example, you have a pipeline that reads from Kafka and writes files to HDFS:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-ParquetBasicPipe.png" scale="70" id="image_b5z_25q_tx"
            /></p>
        <p>When Hadoop FS closes a file, you would like the file moved to a different directory and
            the file permissions changed to read-only. </p>
        <p>Leaving the rest of the pipeline as is, you can enable event handling in the Hadoop FS
            destination, connect it to the HDFS File Metadata executor, and configure the HDFS File
            Metadata executor to files and change permissions. The resulting pipeline looks like
            this:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-EventPipe.png" scale="65" id="image_c5z_25q_tx"/></p>
        <p>If you needed to set permissions differently based on the file name or location, you
            could use a Stream Selector to route the event records accordingly, then use two HDFS
            File Metadata executors to alter file permissions, as follows:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-EventPipe-SSelector.png" id="image_os2_nqf_zx" scale="60"
            /></p>
 </conbody>
