 <title>Event Records in Monitor Mode</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>event records<indexterm>in Monitor mode</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>Monitor
                    mode<indexterm>event records</indexterm></indexterm>In Monitor mode, the
            event-generating stage provides statistics about generated event records. Once the event
            records leave the event-generating stage, Monitor mode treats event records like any
            other record.</p>
        <p>For example, when you run and monitor the pipeline featured above, the Directory origin
            information displays event records in its statistics:</p>
        <p><image href="../Graphics/Event-Monitor-Origin.png" id="image_s1s_g5q_cy" scale="65"/></p>
        <p>Notice, in the Record Throughput chart, that you can hover over graphics to get the exact
            number of records that they represent.</p>
        <p>And when you select the Local FS destination where the event record is written, Monitor
            mode displays statistics for the records written to the destination. At this point, the
            event records are treated like any other record:</p>
