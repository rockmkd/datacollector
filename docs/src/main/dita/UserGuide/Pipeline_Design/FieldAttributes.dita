 <title>Field Attributes</title>
    <shortdesc>Field attributes are attributes that provide additional information about each field
        that you can use in pipeline logic, as needed.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>field attributes<indexterm>overview</indexterm></indexterm>Some stages generate
            field attributes. For example, the Salesforce origin includes the original Salesforce
            data type in the <codeph>salesforce.salesforceType</codeph> attribute for every field. </p>
        <p>You can create, modify, and evaluate field attributes in the pipeline. The Expression
            Evaluator enables creating and modifying field-level attributes. You can use field
            attribute functions to evaluate field attributes.</p>
        <p>For example, you can use an Expression Evaluator to create a field attribute based on
            record data, then pass the record to a Stream Selector that routes data based on the
            value of the attribute. </p>

        <p>When using data preview, you can enable viewing field attributes and record header
            attributes to aid with pipeline development.</p>
