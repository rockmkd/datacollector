 <title>Including Field XPaths and Namespaces</title>
 <conbody>
  <p><indexterm>XML data<indexterm>Including field XPaths and
                namespaces</indexterm></indexterm><indexterm>field XPaths and
                    namespaces<indexterm>in XML data</indexterm></indexterm>You can include field
            XPath expressions and namespaces in the record by enabling the Include Field XPaths
            property. </p>
        <p>When enabled, the record includes the XPath expression for each field as a field
            attribute and includes each namespace in an xmlns record header attribute. By default,
            this information is not included in the record.</p>
        <p>For example, say you have the following XML document:
            <codeblock>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;bookstore xmlns:prc="http://books.com/price">
   &lt;b:book xmlns:b="http://books.com/book">
      &lt;title lang="en">Harry Potter&lt;/title>
      &lt;prc:price>29.99&lt;/prc:price>
   &lt;/b:book>
   &lt;b:book xmlns:b="http://books.com/book">
      &lt;title lang="en_us">Learning XML&lt;/title>
      &lt;prc:price>39.95&lt;/prc:price>
   &lt;/b:book>
&lt;/bookstore></codeblock></p>
        <p>When you use <codeph>/*[1]/*</codeph> as the delimiter element and enable the Include
            Field XPaths property, <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            generates the following records with the highlighted field XPath expressions and
            namespace record header attributes:</p>
