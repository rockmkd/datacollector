 <title>Sending Email</title>
 <conbody>
        <p>You can enable <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/> to
            send email by configuring the email configuration properties. <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            can send email in the following ways:<ul id="ul_lqj_1xg_xz">
                <li><xref href="../Alerts/EmailforAlerts-Configuring.dita#task_f3v_1hw_1r">Email
                        alert</xref> - Sends a basic email when an email-enabled alert is triggered,
                    such as when the error record threshold has been reached.</li>
                <li><xref href="../Pipeline_Configuration/Notifications.dita#concept_mtn_k4j_rz"
                        >Pipeline notification</xref> - Sends a basic email when the pipeline state
                    changes to a specified state. For example, you might use pipeline notification
                    to send an email when a pipeline transitions to a Run_Error or Finished
                    state.</li>
                <li><xref href="../Executors/Email.dita#concept_sjs_sfp_qz">Email executor</xref> -
                    Sends a custom email upon receiving an event from an event-generating stage. Use
                    in an event stream to send a user-defined email. You can include expressions to
                    provide information about the pipeline or event in the email. <p>For example,
                        you might use an Email executor to send an email upon receiving a
                        failed-query event from the Hive Query executor, and you can include the
                        failed query in the message. </p></li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>To enable sending email, in the <ph
                conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
            configuration file, configure the mail.transport.protocol property, and then configure
            the smtp/smtps properties and the xmail properties. For more information, see <xref
                href="ConfiguringDataCollector.dita#task_lxk_kjw_1r"/>.</p>
