 <title>Java Security Manager</title>
 <shortdesc><ph conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
    includes a Java Security Manager that is enabled by default. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Java Security Manager restricts the runtime permissions of user libraries. This allows
   administrators to control what user libraries do on production systems. For example, by default,
   user libraries cannot call out to network resources and potentially cause denial of service
   attacked.</p>
  <p>The security policy is defined in the <codeph>$SDC_CONF/sdc-security.policy</codeph> file. The
      file syntax is <xref
        href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/security/PolicyFiles.html"
        format="html" scope="external">java standard</xref>. </p>
   <p>To disable the Java Security Manager, edit the SDC_SECURITY_MANAGER_ENABLED environment
      variable in the <ph
        conref="../Reusable_Content/ReusablePhrases.dita#concept_vhs_5tz_xp/pName-long"/>
      environment configuration file. </p>
