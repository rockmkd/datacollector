        the pipeline and for stages in the pipeline.  </shortdesc>

                /> console displays pipeline monitoring information when it runs a pipeline. You can
                select a stage to view the statistics about the stage. Similarly, you can view error
                information for the pipeline and its stages. </p>
            <p>The Monitor panel displays statistics on the following tabs:<dl>

                                and batch throughput, batch processing statistics, and heap memory
                                usage. For a pipeline started with runtime parameters, displays the
                                parameter values that the pipeline is currently using.</p>
                            <p>For a stage, displays record and batch throughput, batch processing
                                statistics, and heap memory usage.</p>
