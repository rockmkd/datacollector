 <title>Topic</title>
 <shortdesc>The MQTT Publisher destination writes messages to a single topic on the MQTT broker. Any
        MQTT client subscribed to that topic receives the messages. A topic is a string that the
        broker uses to filter messages for each connected client.</shortdesc>

                    Publisher destination</indexterm></indexterm>When you configure the destination,
            you define the topic name. You can include multiple topic levels in a topic. For
            example, the following topic has three topic
            levels:<codeblock>sales/US/NorthernRegion</codeblock></p>
        <p> You can use the StreamSets expression language to define the topic name. You cannot use
            MQTT wildcards in the topic name used by the MQTT Publisher destination. </p>
