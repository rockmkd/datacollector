 <shortdesc>Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a web transfer protocol designed for
        machine-to-machine devices. The CoAP Client destination writes data to a CoAP endpoint. Use
        the destination to send requests to a CoAP resource URL.</shortdesc>

                    Client</indexterm></indexterm>The CoAP Client destination generates one request
            for each record. When you configure the destination, you define the resource URL and
            method to use for the requests. You configure whether each request is confirmable or
            non-confirmable. You can also configure a connection timeout for each request. </p>
